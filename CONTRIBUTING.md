### Creating a Pull Request

If you would like to contribute to this project you can visit the [Playground](https://devdojo.com/tailwindcss/playground) and create your TailwindCSS component. After creating your component in the playground you'll want to clone the repo on your machine, add that component to a new `.html` file, and submt a Pull Request. (this process will be refined in a couple days).

To request us to review code that you create, you will need to create a pull request as described in
 [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github).

### File Location/Types

### [`components`](./components)

All the TailwindCSS Components for the project are stored in `.html` files located within the [`components`](./components) directory.
